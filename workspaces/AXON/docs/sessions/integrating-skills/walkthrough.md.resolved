# Walkthrough - Official Skills Installation

## Changes Made
- **Global Skill Installation**: Installed the official `vercel-labs/agent-skills` collection into `C:\Users\daria\.gemini\AXON\hive\skills`.
- **Skills Added**:
  - **Official**: [web-design-guidelines](file:///c:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/hive/skills/skills/web-design-guidelines), [react-best-practices](file:///c:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/hive/skills/skills/vercel-react-best-practices), [composition-patterns](file:///c:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/hive/skills/skills/vercel-composition-patterns), `react-native-guidelines`.
  - **Marketing**: Installed 25+ marketing skills including `seo-audit`, `copywriting`, `launch-strategy`, etc.
- **Registry**: Created [hive/skills/SKILL_REGISTRY.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/hive/skills/SKILL_REGISTRY.md) and mapped it to the `/skills` command.
- **Verification**: Validated that [SKILL.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/hive/skills/marketing/SKILL.md) files are accessible and correctly structured in the `hive` directory.

## What Was Tested
- **Official Installation**: Ran `npx skills add` successfully.
- **Marketing Integration**: Copied skills from desktop to `hive/skills/marketing`.
