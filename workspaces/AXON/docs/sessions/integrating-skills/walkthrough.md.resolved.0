# Walkthrough - Official Skills Installation

## Changes Made
- **Global Skill Installation**: Installed the official `vercel-labs/agent-skills` collection into `C:\Users\daria\.gemini\AXON\hive\skills`.
- **Skills Added**:
  - `web-design-guidelines`: Best practices for accessibility, performance, and UX.
  - `vercel-react-best-practices`: Performance optimization guidelines.
  - `vercel-composition-patterns`: React architecture patterns.
  - `vercel-react-native-skills`: Mobile development guidelines.
- **Verification**: Validated that `SKILL.md` files are accessible and correctly structured in the `hive` directory.

## What Was Tested
- **Installation Command**: Ran `npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --all` successfully.
- **Directory Structure**: Confirmed skills are present in `hive/skills` (linked to `.agents`).
- **Content Validation**: Read `web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md` to ensure valid content.

## Validation Results
- **Success**: All skills installed without errors.
- **Accessibility**: Skills are ready to be used by any agent configured to look in `hive/skills`.

> [!TIP]
> You can now use these skills in your prompts or allow agents to automatically discover them for relevant tasks (e.g., "Review my UI code for accessibility").
