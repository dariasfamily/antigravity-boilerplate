# Walkthrough - Official Skills Installation

## Changes Made
- **Global Skill Installation**: Installed the official `vercel-labs/agent-skills` collection into `C:\Users\daria\.gemini\AXON\hive\skills`.
- **Skills Added**:
  - **Official**: `web-design-guidelines`, `react-best-practices`, `composition-patterns`, `react-native-guidelines`.
  - **Marketing**: Installed 25+ marketing skills including `seo-audit`, `copywriting`, `launch-strategy`, etc.
- **Registry**: Created `hive/skills/SKILL_REGISTRY.md` and mapped it to the `/skills` command.
- **Verification**: Validated that `SKILL.md` files are accessible and correctly structured in the `hive` directory.

## What Was Tested
- **Official Installation**: Ran `npx skills add` successfully.
- **Marketing Integration**: Copied skills from desktop to `hive/skills/marketing`.
- **Registry Access**: Verified `SKILL_REGISTRY.md` links to the correct files.
- **Content Validation**: Read `seo-audit/SKILL.md` to ensure valid content.

## Validation Results
- **Success**: All 30+ skills are installed and indexed.
- **Accessibility**: Use `/skills` to view the registry.
- **Discovery**: Use `/search-skills` to find new skills on the registry interactively.

> [!TIP]
> **50k+ Skills**: `skills.sh` is a massive registry (like an App Store). We installed the essentials locally. To find more, use the search command, then ask me to install any specific one you find interesting.
