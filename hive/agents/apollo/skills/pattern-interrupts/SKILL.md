# SKILL: PATTERN INTERRUPTS (SONIC TRIGGERS)

## 1. Objective
Prevent "Scroll Hypnosis" by introducing auditory novelty at regular intervals.

## 2. Strategies
- **The Cut:** Abrupt silence 0.5s before a key word ("Curiosity Gap").
- **The Shift:** Change EQ or Panning (e.g., move voice from Center to Left Ear).
- **The Spike:** A sudden, non-intrusive high-frequency sound (e.g., a "ding" or "click").

## 3. Implementation
- **Frequency:** Every 3-5 seconds.
- **Constraint:** Must not disrupt intelligibility of the speech.
