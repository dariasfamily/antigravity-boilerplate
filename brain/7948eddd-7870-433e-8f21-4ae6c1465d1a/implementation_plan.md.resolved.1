# Implementation Plan: Knowledge Seed Integration (Notebook #1)

Darias has mandated a systematic study of 70 sources to integrate standards, patterns, and executive logic into EGERIA and the AXON architecture.

## Strategy: Recursive Knowledge Integration
Information will be processed in blocks (Phases 0-6).
1.  **Extraction**: Read source content (focused on "FULL" versions).
2.  **Synthesis**: Identify Standards (CSS, JSON), Patterns (Hexagonal, Saga), and Protocols (EET, FFRS).
3.  **Internalization**: Update EGERIA's core identity prompts and the global `SYSTEM_STANDARDS.md` artifact.

## Proposed Blocks

### Phase 0: The Canon (COC)
- Analyze the `COC v1.0 â€” Contrato de OperaciÃ³n CanÃ³nico`.
- Enforce its rules on every subsequent response.

### Phase 1: The Nucleus (FULL Seeds)
- Deep dive into `FULL 3.1` (Data) and `FULL 3.2` (Architecture).
- These define the "Income Factory" blueprint.

### Phases 2-6: Discipline Layers
- Structure, Data Volume, AI Motor, Shield, and Mind logic.

## Verification Plan
### Traceability
- Every standard adopted will be linked to its source ID in the `SS v0` registry.
- EGERIA will demonstrate awareness of new patterns in her reasoning logs.
