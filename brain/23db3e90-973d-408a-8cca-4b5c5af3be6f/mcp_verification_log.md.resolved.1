# MCP Verification Log

## Objective
Verify the functionality of the 'notebooklm' MCP server.

## Findings
- **NotebookLM Server**: 
  - Status: Reachable.
  - Resources: `resources/list` returned empty list (server is active but has no exposed resources currently).
  - Executable: `notebooklm-mcp.exe` exists in `AppData`.
  - Configuration: Enabled in [mcp_config.json](file:///c:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/mcp_config.json).
- **GitHub Server**:
  - Status: Disabled in [mcp_config.json](file:///c:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/mcp_config.json).
  - Result: `resources/list` failed as expected.

## Diagnosis
The NotebookLM MCP server is installed and enabled. The lack of resources might be due to:
1.  Empty NotebookLM account (no notebooks).
2.  Authentication pending (executable requires `notebooklm-mcp-auth`).
3.  Tools not exposed in current session (requires restart or manual tool registration).

## Recommendations
- Run `notebooklm-mcp-auth` if authentication is suspected to be missing.
- Restart the IDE/Agent to refresh tool definitions.
