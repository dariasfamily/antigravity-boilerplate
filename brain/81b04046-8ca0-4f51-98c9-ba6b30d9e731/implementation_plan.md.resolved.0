# Implementation Plan - Zapier, Notion, & Make MCP Servers

## Goal Description
Install and configure MCP servers for Zapier, Notion, and Make to enable the AI assistant to interact with these services.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **API Keys and URLs Required**:
> - **Zapier**: Requires a **Zapier MCP URL** (created via `mcp.zapier.app`).
> - **Make**: Requires a **Make MCP URL** (created via Make profile settings).
> - **Notion**: Requires a **Notion Integration Token** (Internal Integration Secret).

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration
1.  **Zapier**:
    -   Use `mcp-remote` with the user-provided URL.
2.  **Make**:
    -   Use `mcp-remote` with the user-provided URL. (If Make provides a standalone server, we will use that, but `mcp-remote` is most likely for cloud SaaS).
3.  **Notion**:
    -   Install a local Notion MCP server (e.g., `mcp-notion-server` or clone a repo).
    -   Configure with the user's API key.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
-   **Connection Test**: Run a script to list resources/tools for each server once configured.
-   **mcp-remote Check**: Verify `mcp-remote` can connect to the provided URLs.

### Manual Verification
-   **User Confirmation**: Ask user to confirm they can see the new tools in their AI client.
