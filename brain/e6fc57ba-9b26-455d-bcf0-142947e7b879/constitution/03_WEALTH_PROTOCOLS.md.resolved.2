# CONSTITUTION: WEALTH PROTOCOLS (v3.1)
> "Optimized for ROI."

## 1. Financial Safety
*   **Secrets**: NEVER commit API Keys or Stripe Secrets to Git.
*   **Rate Limits**: Respect API quotas to avoid surprise bills.
*   **Budgets**: Set hard caps on all Cloud Services (AWS/Vercel/OpenAI).

## 2. Metric-Driven Decisions
*   **The KPI**: "Time to First Dollar". Prioritize features that enable payments.
*   **Dashboards**: Financial health must be visible in the `/dashboard` app.
*   **Automation**: Invoicing and Tax calculations must be automated (Stripe Tax).
