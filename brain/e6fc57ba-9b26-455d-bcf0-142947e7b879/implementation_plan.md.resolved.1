# Implementation Plan - Wealth Dashboard (The Eyes)

The goal is to verify the "Wealth Brain" by visualizing the data residing in the `wealth_assets` and `wealth_transactions` tables.
This will solve the "Blindness" gap identified in the System Audit.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plan includes installing **ShadCN UI**, a high-quality component library. This fixes the `src/components/ui` missing directory error reported by the Auditor.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Structure & Dependencies (Fixing the Skeleton)
#### [NEW] ShadCN UI Installation
- Run `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` to scaffold the UI system.
- Install core components: `card`, `table`, `button`, `input`.
- **Reason**: We need premium aesthetics ("World Class Design") as per the Constitution.

### 2. Wealth Division UI (`src/modules/wealth`)
#### [NEW] [WealthDashboard](file:///src/components/wealth/WealthDashboard.tsx)
- A high-level client component to orchestrate the view.
- Displays: "Total Net Worth", "Monthly Cashflow" (calculated from DB).

#### [NEW] [AssetTable](file:///src/components/wealth/AssetTable.tsx)
- A table listing all assets from `wealth_assets`.
- Columns: Name, Type, Value, Currency, Status.

### 3. Application Route (`src/app`)
#### [NEW] [Page](file:///src/app/dashboard/wealth/page.tsx)
- The main entry point.
- Protected by Supabase Auth (already in middleware).
- Fetches initial data server-side for SEO/Performance.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npx tsx src/scripts/auditor.ts` to confirm `src/components/ui` now exists (Auditor should pass ✅).
- access `/dashboard/wealth` to verify the UI loads.

### Manual Verification
- User will visit the dashboard.
- If data is empty, we will create a "Seeding Script" to populate dummy wealth data.
