# Dashboard V3: The Command Deck Upgrade

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mission Accomplished**: The AXON Dashboard has been upgraded to **V3 (Command Deck)**.
> This update brings "Deep Observability", "Cinematic Visualization", and "Military-Grade Control" to the agent system.

## 1. New Core Features

### ðŸ” Context Inspector (Deep Observability)
Replacing the simple log view, the **Context Inspector** provides a real-time X-Ray of the system's brain.
*   **JSON Tree View**: Inspect the raw [SystemContext](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/scratch/AXON-boilerplate/src/types/agent_types.ts#234-246) state (Global variables, Agent memory).
*   **System Logs Tab**: A filterable, color-coded table of every action taken by the agents.
*   **Live Updates**: Watch the system think in real-time.

### ðŸŒŠ Pipeline Visualizer (Cinematic Flow)
The "Agent Checklist" has been reimagined as a **3D Pipeline Visualizer**.
*   **Visual Logic**: Shows the flow of data from ORION -> CALLIOPE -> ARGUS -> ECHO.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars for each agent's active task.
*   **Status Indicators**: Color-coded halos (Red=Active, Green=Done, Blue=Idle).
*   **Glassmorphism**: A sleek, elite UI that floats above the dashboard.

### ðŸŽ›ï¸ Agent Control Panels V2 (Tactical Command)
We've completely refactored the Agent Cards into professional **Control Panels**.
*   **Split View**:
    *   **INPUT Tab**: Configure settings, set topics, and adjust parameters.
    *   **OUTPUT Tab**: View the raw results, logs, and artifacts generated by the agent.
*   **Real-time Config**: Update timeouts and output formats on the fly.
*   **Action Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback when an agent is triggered (Pulse animations).

### ðŸ“Š Analytics Overview (ROI Engine)
Replacing the static System Map is the new **Analytics Overview**.
*   **Financial Metrics**: Track Revenue, MRR, and Profit Margins.
*   **Engagement Data**: View Counts, Comments, and Reach.
*   **Time Filters**: Toggle between 24h, 7d, 30d, and 1y views.
*   **System Health**: Monitor active agents and uptime.

### ðŸ”’ Security (Knowledge Protection)
The **Active Knowledge Source** is now protected.
*   **Lock Screen**: Access to sensitive NotebookLM links requires the code: `AXON`.
*   **Visual Security**: A "Classified" interface prevents unauthorized viewing.

## 2. Technical Improvements
*   **Refactored State Management**: Fixed React rendering errors for smoother performance.
*   **Component Modularity**: New components ([ContextInspector](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/scratch/AXON-boilerplate/src/components/dashboard/ContextInspector.tsx#5-91), [AnalyticsOverview](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/scratch/AXON-boilerplate/src/components/dashboard/AnalyticsOverview.tsx#6-156), [AgentControlPanel](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/scratch/AXON-boilerplate/src/components/dashboard/AgentControlPanel.tsx#14-219)) are self-contained and reusable.
*   **Elite UI/UX**: Enhanced animations, gradients, and typography (Inter/Geist Mono) for a premium feel.

> [!TIP]
> **Try it out**: Go to your dashboard (`/dashboard`) and watch the **Context Inspector** update as you run **ORION** or **CALLIOPE**.
