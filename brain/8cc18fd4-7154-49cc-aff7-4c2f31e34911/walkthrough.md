# Walkthrough: User Identity Correction

I have performed a system-wide audit and correction to ensure the user is correctly addressed as **Darias**.

## Changes Made

### Key Artifacts Updated
- **[agent_midas_definition.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/brain/dfe95997-2930-442b-85c6-21d08da1e15c/agent_midas_definition.md)**: Updated `User (Daria)` to `User (Darias)`.
- **[GEMINI.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/brain/e6fc57ba-9b26-455d-bcf0-142947e7b879/GEMINI.md)**: Updated all instances of "Daria" in the system constitution and audit protocols.
- **[task.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/brain/8cc18fd4-7154-49cc-aff7-4c2f31e34911/task.md)**: Successfully tracked and verified the correction.

### Verification Results
I used `grep_search` and PowerShell `Select-String` to confirm that:
1.  All textual references to the user as "Daria" have been replaced with "Darias".
2.  System-enforced file paths (e.g., `C:/Users/daria/...`) remain untouched to maintain OS-level compatibility.
3.  New communications and system prompts for agents (like Egeria) and Hive configurations correctly use **Darias**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Hive configuration in `hive/config.yaml` was already correct as `owner: "Darias"`, ensuring the core system identity remains stable.

The system is now fully aligned with your correct name.
