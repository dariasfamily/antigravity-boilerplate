# Plan: Correcting User Identity to "Darias"

The user (Darias) pointed out that I used the name "Daria" incorrectly in my last communications and artifacts. This plan outlines the steps to correct this across the current task and system metadata.

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration & Documentation

#### [MODIFY] [task.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/brain/8cc18fd4-7154-49cc-aff7-4c2f31e34911/task.md)
Update the current task list to reflect the correct name.

#### [MODIFY] [agent_midas_definition.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/brain/dfe95997-2930-442b-85c6-21d08da1e15c/agent_midas_definition.md)
Update line 56: `User (Daria)` -> `User (Darias)`.

#### [MODIFY] [Constitution Sources]
I will update the "Interaction" rule in any constitution source file found. Specifically searching for `Interaction: ALWAYS address the User (Daria)`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will NOT change system-enforced paths like `C:/Users/daria/...` as these correspond to the OS user account and changing them would break system functionality.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  Verify that subsequent communications correctly address the user as "Darias".
2.  Verify that `task.md` and `agent_midas_definition.md` show the corrected name.
