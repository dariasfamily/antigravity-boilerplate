# Task: Correcting User Identity to Dariass

- [/] Search for all instances of "Daria" in the codebase and documentation
- [ ] Filter out non-user references (like file paths or directory names if they are system-enforced, though usually they should match)
- [ ] Replace "Daria" with "Darias" in:
    - [ ] [agents_registry.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/hive/agents/agents_registry.md)
    - [ ] Any other identified documentation
    - [ ] System prompts/Constitution files (if found in the workspace)
- [ ] Confirm correction to Darias
