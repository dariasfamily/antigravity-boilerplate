# Plan: Versioning and Signing for Mirror Workflow

The user requested versioning and signatures for the `/mirror` workflow. I will also confirm if [SS_v1.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/eed5dfb5-4975-42e9-b615-492a03592430/SS_v1.md) is now a perfect mirror.

## Proposed Changes

### [Workflows]

#### [MODIFY] [mirror.md](file:///c:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/workspaces/AXON/.agent/workflows/mirror.md)
- Add YAML frontmatter for version, author, and date.
- Add a signature/audit footer at the bottom of the file.

### [Knowledge Base / Brain]

#### [MODIFY] [SS_v1.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/eed5dfb5-4975-42e9-b615-492a03592430/SS_v1.md)
- Perform one last literal comparison to ensure 100% mirror fidelity.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify the mirror workflow has the version and date.
- Confirm the SS_v1 document is 100% identical in content to the original extraction.
