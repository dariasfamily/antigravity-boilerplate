# Plan: AXON Grammar & Architecture blue-printing

Materializing the AXON v1.7 architectural vision into formal engineering documents.

## Proposed Changes

### [Knowledge Base / Brain]

#### [NEW] [axon_grammar.yaml](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/eed5dfb5-4975-42e9-b615-492a03592430/axon_grammar.yaml)
- Define the formal schema for agents, modules, layers (L1/L2/L3), and control units (UCC/EMA).
- Specify the datatypes for the 50+ fields in the Deliverable Object.
- Formalize the structure of logs (LITE/FULL) and snapshots.

#### [NEW] [AXON_Architecture.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/eed5dfb5-4975-42e9-b615-492a03592430/AXON_Architecture.md)
- Create a comprehensive Mermaid diagram showing the interaction between the UCC, Failover Manager, Adaptive Orchestrator, and the 3-layer memory system.
- Map the flow from User Input to the 50+ field Object Entregable.

#### [MODIFY] [walkthrough.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/eed5dfb5-4975-42e9-b615-492a03592430/walkthrough.md)
- Document the addition of these blueprints as the foundation for the next "Execution" phase.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Internal Consistency Check:** Ensure the YAML schema accurately reflects all protocols (PROT-001 to PROT-009).
- **Visual Validation:** Confirm the architecture diagram accurately represents the "Failover" and "Adaptivity" logic.
