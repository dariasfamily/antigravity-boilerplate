# Plan: Create System Specification v1 (FFRS)

This plan outlines the creation of the `SS_v1.md` document, which serves as the formal framework of requirements and scope (FFRS) for the Antigravity/AXON system, based on the extraction provided by Darias.

## Proposed Changes

### [Knowledge Base / Brain]

#### [NEW] [SS_v1.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/eed5dfb5-4975-42e9-b615-492a03592430/SS_v1.md)
Creation of the system specification document containing:
1. Integrations (Antigravity, ComfyUI, Gemini, ChatGPT, NotebookLM)
2. Agent System (Architecture, Roles, Constructor)
3. Pipeline & Traceability (Radiology of process)
4. Deliverable Object (50+ fields structure)
5. Knowledge Management (Cerebro notebooks)
6. Extensions & Scraping (YT, IG, TikTok)
7. Data Model (Titan 5.3)
8. Audit & Governance
9. Standardization & Feedback
10. Operational Checklist

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify that all points from the original extraction are present in the new document without loss of information.
- Ensure the document follows the "Antigravity Style" and technical standards.
- Confirm the file is correctly stored in the brain directory.
