It returns formatted location data and imagery about establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest.\\n\\n**Note:** Google Maps Platform provides separate versions of the Places library for [Android](/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/overview) , [iOS](/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/overview) , and [JavaScript](/maps/documentation/javascript/places) . We recommend that you use the version of the Places library specific to your platform. That is, if you are developing an Android app, you should use the Android version of Places.\\n\\n## Why use the Places API (New)\\n\\nCreate location-aware features to make detailed location data available to your users. The data available through the Places API (New) is built on one of the most accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive place models of the real world. Here are example use cases for applications:\\n\\n  - Display condo rentals within major metropolitan areas with results targeted specifically to cities.\\n  - Include place details in a pickup or delivery status update.\\n  - Display a list of parks in an area along with user-submitted photos and reviews.\\n  - Provide people planning trips with contact information, reviews, and price levels for establishments along the way.\\n\\n**Note:** Places API (New) is the current version. Places API is now Legacy and can no longer be enabled. Legacy documentation and migration guides are available on the [Legacy](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview-legacy) tab.\\n\\n## What can you do with the Places API (New)\\n\\nYou can use the Places API (New) to include the following features in your applications:\\n\\n  - Provide place search results from different types of users queries, such as text input, nearby locations, and ambiguous or categorical user queries.\\n  - Enable autocomplete features for different search types, either specific text queries or categorical queries.\\n  - Refine the type of details returned about a place, such as operating hours, a summary, user reviews, and a photo.\\n  - Add high-quality photos to locations served by your application.\\n\\nMany Google Maps Platform APIs support [place IDs](/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id) , where the place ID uniquely identifies a place in the Google Places database and on Google Maps. There are many ways to obtain a place ID, including from the Places API (New), but also from the [Geocoding API](/maps/documentation/geocoding) , [Routes API](/maps/documentation/routes) , and [Address Validation API](/maps/documentation/address-validation) .\\n\\nOnce you have a place ID, you can use the Places API (New) to request more details about a particular establishment or point of interest, such as its complete address, phone number, user rating, and reviews.\\n\\n## How the Places API (New) works\\n\\nPlaces API (New) accepts requests as a standard URL with a specific service endpoint, such as `  /places  ` or `  places:searchText  ` and returns a JSON response. Places API (New) supports authorization by API key and OAuth token. The following example makes a Place Details (New) request to return the address components for a place ID using an API key:\\n\\n``` text\\nhttps://places.googleapis.com/v1/places/GyuEmsRBfy61i59si0?fields=addressComponents&key=YOUR_API_KEY\\n```\\n\\n## How to use the Places API (New)\\n\\nThe steps below cover a typical use case scenario for using the Places API service. As you build out your solution, you can use additional endpoints, such as Nearby Search (New) and Place Photos (New).\\n\\n<table>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr class=\"odd\">\\n<td>1</td>\\n<td><strong>Get set up</strong></td>\\n<td>Start with <a href=\"/maps/documentation/elevation/cloud-setup\">Set up your Google Cloud project</a> and complete the setup instructions that follow and then learn <a href=\"/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key\">how to use your API key</a> .</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\"even\">\\n<td>2</td>\\n<td><strong>Try a basic text search</strong></td>\\n<td>Issue a text search by using <a href=\"/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search\">Text Search (New)</a> .</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr class=\"odd\">\\n<td>3</td>\\n<td><strong>Use the place ID for more details</strong></td>\\n<td>Many Google Maps Platform APIs return a place ID as part of a response.

Functionality varies by region. [Learn more](/maps/comms/eea/faq) .\\n\\nThis feature requires that you enable Places API (New), the next generation of the Places API. For more information, see [Enable APIs](/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/cloud-setup#enabling-apis) .\\n\\nThe Places SDK for iOS (New) provides your app with rich information about places, including the place\\'s name and address, the geographical location specified as latitude/longitude coordinates, the type of place (such as night club, pet store, museum), and more. To access this information for a specific place, you can use the place ID, a stable identifier that uniquely identifies a place.\\n\\n## Get place details\\n\\nThe [`  GMSPlace  `](/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPlace) class contains information about a specific place, including all of the data fields shown in [Place Data Fields (New)](/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/data-fields) .

Your testing should cover several key areas, addressing all elements you have implemented: the Place Details, Place Search, and Basic Place Autocomplete elements.\\n\\n**Place Details Element**\\n\\nFor the Place Details Element, begin by verifying that details are displayed correctly for a diverse range of places. Test by passing various Place IDs to the `  .place  ` property of the `  <gmp-place-details-place-request>  ` element. Use IDs representing different establishment types (businesses with rich data, points of interest, basic addresses) and places in different regions or languages. Pay close attention to the formatting, layout, and presence of the content.\\n\\n**Place Search Element**\\n\\nIf you\\'ve implemented the Place Search Element, verify its rendering and behavior under different search scenarios.\\n\\n  - For a Text Search, test by setting the `  textQuery  ` property on the `  <gmp-place-text-search-request>  ` element with various inputs: broad queries, specific addresses, and queries with location biases.\\n  - For a Nearby Search, test by setting the `  locationRestriction  ` and `  includedTypes  ` properties on the `  <gmp-place-nearby-search-request>  ` element. Use different location sizes, and type filters.\\n\\nConfirm that the list populates with relevant results and that the `  gmp-select  ` event fires correctly upon selection.\\n\\n**Basic Place Autocomplete Element**\\n\\nFor the Basic Place Autocomplete Element, focus testing on user interaction and the data passed by the selection event. Confirm that the `  gmp-select  ` event fires reliably when a user clicks a prediction. Verify that the `  event.place  ` object in the event handler contains a valid Place ID.\\n\\nMost importantly, test the end-to-end flow: select a place from the Autocomplete drop-down and verify its Place ID can be successfully used to populate another element, such as the Place Details Element.\\n\\n**Error handling**\\n\\nRigorous testing of error handling is essential across all components. Simulate passing invalid or non-existent Place IDs to the Place Details Element, or using invalid search parameters for the Place Search Element. Trigger the `  gmp-requesterror  ` event by simulating network issues or using an invalid API key to make sure your application handles it gracefully. Implement user-friendly error messages and logging to prevent a broken or confusing UI."},{"apiStatus":"NEW","documentationUrl":"developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/details-place","score":0.7441888451576233,"text":"**European Economic Area (EEA) developers**\\n\\nIf your billing address is in the European Economic Area, effective on 8 July 2025, the [Google Maps Platform EEA Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms/maps-platform/eea) will apply to your use of the Services.

See [Use API Keys](/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) for more information, including restricting a key.\\n\\n### Update Maps JavaScript API Loading\\n\\nThe Places UI Kit requires the [Dynamic Library Import](/maps/documentation/javascript/load-maps-js-api#dynamic-library-import) method of loading the Maps JavaScript API. If you are using the [direct script loading tag](/maps/documentation/javascript/load-maps-js-api#use-legacy-tag) , this must be updated.\\n\\nOnce you have updated the loading script for the Maps JavaScript API, [import the required libraries](/maps/documentation/javascript/places-ui-kit/get-started#load-the-required-libraries) to use Places UI Kit.\\n\\n## Implement the Place Details Element\\n\\nThe [Place Details Element](/maps/documentation/javascript/places-ui-kit/place-details#place-details-element) and [Place Details Compact Element](/maps/documentation/javascript/places-ui-kit/place-details#place-details-compact-element) are HTML elements that render details for a place.\\n\\n### Current Implementation\\n\\n  - You perform a Place Details call using a HTTP request, or use the JavaScript API Place Class.\\n  - You parse the API response, and display the place details using HTML and CSS.\\n\\n### Migration to Place Details Element\\n\\n#### Modify HTML Structure\\n\\nIdentify the HTML container where place details are rendered. Replace your custom HTML elements (divs, spans for name, address, photos, etc.) with the Place Details Element html.\\n\\nThere are two elements to pick from:\\n\\n  - Place Details Compact Element\\n  - Place Details Element\\n\\nFor more information about which one to use, see [Place Details Element](/maps/documentation/javascript/places-ui-kit/place-details) .\\n\\nYour existing HTML may look like this.\\n\\n``` text\\n<div id=\"my-place-details-container\">\\n    <h2 id=\"place-name\"></h2>\\n    <p id=\"place-address\"></p>\\n    <img id=\"place-photo\" src=\"\" alt=\"Place photo\">\\n    <!-- ... more custom elements -->\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nExample new HTML, explicitly stating which [content](/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/places-widget#PlaceContentConfigElement) to display:\\n\\n``` text\\n<gmp-place-details-compact orientation=\"horizontal\" truncation-preferred style=\"display: none;\">\\n    <gmp-place-details-place-request></gmp-place-details-place-request>\\n    <gmp-place-content-config>\\n        <gmp-place-media lightbox-preferred></gmp-place-media>\\n        <gmp-place-address></gmp-place-address>\\n        <gmp-place-rating></gmp-place-rating>\\n        <gmp-place-type></gmp-place-type>\\n        <gmp-place-price></gmp-place-price>\\n        <gmp-place-accessible-entrance-icon></gmp-place-accessible-entrance-icon>\\n        <gmp-place-open-now-status></gmp-place-open-now-status>\\n    </gmp-place-content-config>\\n</gmp-place-details-compact>\\n```\\n\\n#### Adapt JavaScript Logic\\n\\n##### Existing logic\\n\\nYour existing logic likely involves:\\n\\n  - Retrieving a Place ID.\\n  - Using `  PlacesService().getDetails()  ` or making a web service call.\\n  - Specifying a fields array (for JS API) or FieldMask (for web service) to request specific data.\\n  - In the callback resolution, manually selecting your HTML elements and populating them with the received data.\\n\\nThe following is an example of how you may have Place Details implemented:\\n\\n``` text\\nasync function getPlaceDetails(placeId) {\\n    const { Place } = await google.maps.importLibrary(\\'places\\');\\n    // Use place ID to create a new Place instance.\\n    const place = new Place({\\n        id: placeId\\n    });\\n    await place.fetchFields({\\n        fields: [\\'displayName\\', \\'formattedAddress\\', \\'location\\'],\\n    });\\n    // Log the result\\n    console.log(place.displayName);\\n    console.log(place.formattedAddress);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** Your logic may look different if you are using a REST API call, or the legacy JavaScript library.\\n\\n##### New logic\\n\\nYour new logic will involve:\\n\\n  - Retrieve your Place ID or Place Object.\\n  - Get a reference to the `  <gmp-place-details-place-request>  ` element.\\n  - Pass the Place ID or the Place Object to the place property on the `"},{"apiStatus":"NEW","documentationUrl":"developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/legacy/migrate-details","score":0.7418915629386902,"text":"This feature requires that you enable Places API (New), the next generation of the Places API.
