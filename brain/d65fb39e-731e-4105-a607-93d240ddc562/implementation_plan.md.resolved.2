# Implementation Plan - Agent ORION Definition

## Goal Description
Create a comprehensive definition for **Agent ORION** (Analytic/Investigative Agent) by synthesizing multiple sources of input provided by the user. This definition will serve as the "Source of Truth" for this agent within the multi-agent ecosystem.

## User Review Required
- Confirmation that the integration of the "Elite Screenwriter" audit points into the Analytic Agent's knowledge base is correct (as requested: "Integrate all... specifically the 3 JSON structures faithfully").

## Proposed Changes

### Brain / Documentation
#### [NEW] [ORION_AGENT_DEFINITION.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/brain/d65fb39e-731e-4105-a607-93d240ddc562/ORION_AGENT_DEFINITION.md)
- **Role & Purpose**: Define Orion as the Research/Analytic engine.
- **Knowledge Architecture**:
    - **Block A (Cognitive Nucleus)**: Psychology, Narrative Structure, Hooks, Viral Metrics.
    - **Block B (Strategic/Technical)**: Production, Editing, Trends, Case Studies.
    - **Block C (Logistics/Viability)**: Pre-production, Brand Consistency.
- **Operational Flow**:
    - Usage in bootstrapping, scoring, and transfer.
    - Rules for interaction with other agents (Evaluator, Generator, Critic).
- **System Integration**:
    - JSON schemas for interoperability.
    - **Input Schema (High-Definition)**:
        - Module 1: Strategic Context (Brand, KPI).
        - Module 2: Characters & Relations.
        - Module 3: Visual & Spatial Engineering.
        - Module 4: Sound & Verbal Design.
        - Module 5: Emotional Architecture & CTA.
    - **Technical Logic (Business Rules)**:
        - Marketing Frameworks (P.O.S.E., 3-Second Rule, Linklater).
        - Decision Logic (Validation, Virality, Monetization Functions).
        - Operational Guidelines (Must-Dos, Anti-Patterns).
    - Input/Output specifications.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Verify that every JSON key/category from the user prompt is present in the final artifact.
- Ensure the hierarchy is logical and "governs the structure of this agent".
