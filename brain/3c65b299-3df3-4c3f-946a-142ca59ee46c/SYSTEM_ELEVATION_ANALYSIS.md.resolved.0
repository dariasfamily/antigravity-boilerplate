# 🧬 SYSTEM ELEVATION ANALYSIS ("TITAN UPGRADE")
**Objective**: Elevate System to "Level Superior" (+3 Levels).
**Source**: User Comments on [SYSTEM_UPGRADE_ROADMAP.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/brain/3c65b299-3df3-4c3f-946a-142ca59ee46c/SYSTEM_UPGRADE_ROADMAP.md).

## 1. REAL-TIME CORE (The "Pulse" of the System)
*Requirement: "Real-time manageability, editing, registry, report, access, consult, auto-evaluate, auto-corrected..."*

- [ ] **Real-Time Registry**: Interactive Database that updates instantly.
- [ ] **Real-Time Auto-Evaluation**: Agents must grade their own performance *during* execution.
- [ ] **Real-Time Auto-Correction**: Agents must fix errors autonomously before reporting.
- [ ] **Real-Time Adaptation**: System must ingest new agents and adapt the UI automatically.
- [ ] **Optimized Context Stream**: API must be fast, efficient, and planned (minimal latency).

## 2. THE "DEEP SCHEMA" FOUNDATION (The "Nucleus")
*Requirement: "Create complete data tables, solid foundations, specialized decision tracking..."*

- [ ] **Extended Metrics**: Agents must report internal health, memory usage, and logic-path decisions.
- [ ] **Interrelated DB**: Tables must link Input <-> Manifest <-> Logic <-> Outcome for deep tracing.
- [ ] **Session Metadata**: Track User, Location, Platform, Timestamp, Duration for every interaction.
- [ ] **Deep Asset Tracking**: File sizes, storage locations, ownership, cost centers.

## 3. THE "AGENT CHASSIS" (Standardized Template)
*Requirement: "Homologous structure for all, specialized internal logic..."*

- [ ] **Homologous Skeleton**: Every agent (Orion, Calliope) shares the exact same Input/Output/State envelope.
- [ ] **Specialization Zones**: Isolated Logic files where the unique "Intelligence" lives.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: Improvements in one agent must update the "Master Template" (Orion).
- [ ] **Logic Auditor**: A permanent "Internal Affairs" module that monitors the logic zones.

## 4. THE "GOD VIEW" DASHBOARD
*Requirement: "Reach the smallest cell. 500% Functionality."*

- [ ] **Role-Based Views**:
    - **Engineer (Darias)**: Full Raw Access, Memory Dumps, Config Edits.
    - **Executive**: ROI, High-Level Status.
    - **Guest**: Read-only, limited scope.
- [ ] **Granular Controls**:
    - **Actions**: Stop, Pause, Restart, Export, Download, Modify.
    - **UI**: Movable panels, collapsible sections, comparison views, graphs.
- [ ] **State Inspector**:
    - View/Edit Ram (Ephemeral).
    - View/Edit DB (Persistent).
    - View Hidden/System fields (Read-only).

## 5. THE "MEGA AUDIT" (The Gatekeeper)
*Requirement: "Police at the door. Critical, doubtful, punishing, rewarding..."*

- [ ] **Strict Verification**: The Audit script must act as a strict adversary, not just a logger.
- [ ] **Cross-Diff Reports**: Before upgrading an agent, show exactly what changed (Diffs).
- [ ] **"No Data Loss" Guarantee**: State freezing, snapshots to `brain/snapshots/`, undo capability.

## 🗺️ EXECUTION PLAN: THE "TITAN" ARCHITECTURE

### Phase A: The Nucleus (Deep Backend)
Design the **Supabase Schema** that supports this level of interconnectivity.
*   *Table: `ag_sessions`* (Who, When, Where)
*   *Table: `ag_agent_states`* (Live RAM snapshots)
*   *Table: `ag_logic_decisions`* (Why did Orion choose X?)

### Phase B: The Chassis (Agent V4.0)
Refactor Orion to be the **Self-Correcting Template**.
*   Add `auto_correct()` function to Logic.
*   Add `self_evaluate()` function to Output.

### Phase C: The Gatekeeper (Audit V2)
Write the `verify_agent_integrity.ts` script.
*   Simulates "The Police". Checks schemas, tests recovery, grades performance.

### Phase D: The God View (Frontend)
Build the **Dashboard V4**.
*   Implement Redux/Zustand for "Time Travel" debugging (Undo/Redo state).
