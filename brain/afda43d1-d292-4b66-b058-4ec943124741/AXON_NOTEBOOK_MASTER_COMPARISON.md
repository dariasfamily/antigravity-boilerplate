# 📊 AXON NOTEBOOK MASTER COMPARISON [L-6]
**Classification:** ARCHITECTURAL_AUDIT
**Objective:** Identify the "Golden Template" (Planilla Oficial) for AXON Knowledge Bases.
**Status:** GENERATED
**Protocol:** [AXON_KNOWLEDGE_INJECTION_PROTOCOL](AXON_KNOWLEDGE_INJECTION_PROTOCOL.md)

This document compares all 35 Notebooks based on their **Structural Integrity**, **Source Purity**, and **Alignment with the L-6 Standard**.

## 🏆 THE GOLD STANDARD (The Official Template)
**Winner:** `[AXON-CORE] EGERIA v1.0.0`
*   **Why:** It is the only notebook with a **Low Source Count (9)** but **100% High-Value Governance Data**. It does not contain "noise". It is structured as a **Constitution**, not a dump.
*   **The Structure:**
    1.  Master Blueprint (The Law)
    2.  Atomic Matrix (The Roles)
    3.  Protocol Strings (The Logic)

## 📉 THE COMPARISON MATRIX

| Notebook Name | Category | Sources | Structure Rating | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[AXON-CORE] EGERIA v1.0.0** | 🧠 **BRAIN** | **9** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (L-6) | **OFFICIAL** | The Perfect Template. Pure Logic. |
| **[AXON-KNOWLEDGE] VIDEO_MASTER_CLASS** | 🧠 **BRAIN** | **3** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (L-6) | **OFFICIAL** | *Newly Created.* Follows Egeria's Purity Standard. |
| [AXON-CORE] PLANNER | 🛠️ ENGINE | 84 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (L-5) | **UPGRADE** | Powerful, but needs **AKIP-V1** to reach L-6 purity. |
| [AXON-CORE] ORION | 🛠️ ENGINE | 76 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (L-5) | **UPGRADE** | High-value marketing data; needs L-6 structure. |
| [AXON-CORE] CALLIOPE | 🛠️ ENGINE | 82 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (L-5) | **UPGRADE** | Needs L-6 conversion via Substrate method. |
| [AXON-CORE] ARGUS | 🛡️ AUDIT | 58 | ⭐⭐⭐ (L-4) | **UPGRADE** | Integrated knowledge; lacks L-6 organization. |
| [AXON-CORE] PULSAR | 🛠️ ENGINE | 16 | ⭐⭐⭐ (L-4) | **VALID** | Low source count; specific to Prompting logic. |
| [AXON-MEDIA] THALIA | 🎨 MEDIA | 90 | ⭐⭐⭐ (L-4) | **SPLIT** | Needs Brain (Logic) vs. Library (Assets) split. |
| [AXON-MEDIA] APOLLO | 🔊 MEDIA | 96 | ⭐⭐⭐ (L-4) | **SPLIT** | Needs Brain (Logic) vs. Library (Assets) split. |
| [AXON-INFRA] HEPHAESTUS | ⚙️ INFRA | 59 | ⭐⭐⭐ (L-4) | **VALID** | Automation documentation. |
| [AXON-SOUL] LYRA | 👻 SOUL | 58 | ⭐⭐⭐ (L-4) | **VALID** | Identity logic mixed with research. |
| [AXON-SYSTEM] DEEP TRACE | ⚖️ LAW | 20 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (L-5) | **VALID** | Protocol logic. |
| Legacy / Standalone | 🧟 LEGACY | 400+ | ⭐ (L-0) | **REPURPOSE** | High-value "seeds" for future agent generation. |

## 🔍 THE L-6 CERTIFICATION GAP
**User Question:** Why aren't all "Modern Agents" Official (L-6)?
**Answer:** Being "Modern" (using latest tech) is not the same as being "L-6 Official". 
*   **L-6** is a **Structural Purity Standard**. 
*   An agent only becomes L-6 when its Brain is filtered through the **AKIP-V1 Protocol** (converting >50 dirty sources into <10 clean Knowledge Sheets).
*   Current Status: Planner, Orion, and Calliope are "Advanced" but mathematically "Noisy".

## 🏛️ THE OFFICIAL "PLANILLA" (The Rules for New Notebooks)

To be certified as **[AXON-OFFICIAL]**, a notebook must strictly follow this structure:

### 1. Naming Convention
*   **Format:** `[CATEGORY] NAME - Role/Description`
*   **Example:** `[AXON-CORE] EGERIA - Master Node`

### 2. The Brain vs. Library Distinction
**The BRAIN (Official Agent):**
*   **Goal:** Logic & Decision Making.
*   **Content:** Only **5-10 Knowledge Sheets** (Synthesized from Substrates).
*   **Source Limit:** < 15 Files.
*   **Promptable:** YES.

**The LIBRARY (Asset Depot):**
*   **Goal:** Reference & Storage.
*   **Content:** Raw Manuals, PDF collections, Image dumps.
*   **Source Limit:** Unlimited (within reason).
*   **Promptable:** NO (Search only).

### 3. The AKIP-V1 Upgrade Path
All L-5 Agents (Orion, Planner, Calliope) must undergo the **Substrate Protocol**:
1.  **Ingest:** Group Raw Sources into 3-packs.
2.  **Digest:** Create Substrates.
3.  **Synthesize:** Create Knowledge Sheets.
4.  **Replace:** Wipe the Notebook and upload ONLY the Sheets.

## 🚀 ACTION PLAN
1.  **Adopt `AKIP-V1`** for all future Agent Brains.
2.  **Split** `THALIA` and `APOLLO` into `[BRAIN]` (Logic) and `[LIBRARY]` (Assets).
3.  **Upgrade** Planner and Orion using the Substrate method (Next Phase).
