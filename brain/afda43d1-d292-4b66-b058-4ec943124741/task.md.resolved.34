# AXON SYSTEM L-6 — 8 CONCURRENT THREADS

## 🔴 THREAD 1: Video Anatomy (Technical) [COMPLETED]
- [x] Defined Codecs, Containers, and Pixel Logic.
- [x] Injected into `VIDEO_MASTER_CLASS`.

## 🟠 THREAD 2: Video Production Spec (Matrix) [COMPLETED]
- [x] Defined Agent Responsibilities (Planner, Thalia, Apollo, etc.).
- [x] Defined `AXON_VIDEO_PACKET_SPEC` (JSON).
- [x] Injected into `VIDEO_MASTER_CLASS`.

## 🟡 THREAD 3: Agent Registry & Roles [VALIDATED]
- [x] Confirmed Agent Roles match their Brains.
- [!] **GAP:** "Modern Agents" (Planner, Orion, Calliope) are L-5. They need AKIP-V1 upgrade to be L-6 Official.

## 🟢 THREAD 4: Context Rail Protocol [COMPLETED]
- [x] Enforced `MODE: EXECUTION` in SystemChat.

## 🔵 THREAD 5: Database Schema [COMPLETED]
- [x] [SUPABASE_SCHEMA_MAESTRO.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/afda43d1-d292-4b66-b058-4ec943124741/SUPABASE_SCHEMA_MAESTRO.md) deployed.

## 🟣 THREAD 6: Version Control [PENDING USER]
- [ ] Git Repo initialized. Needs Remote URL.

## ⚫ THREAD 7: Forensic Audit [COMPLETED]
- [x] Audited 35 Notebooks.
- [x] Created [AXON_NOTEBOOK_MASTER_COMPARISON.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/afda43d1-d292-4b66-b058-4ec943124741/AXON_NOTEBOOK_MASTER_COMPARISON.md).
- [x] Created [AXON_KNOWLEDGE_INJECTION_PROTOCOL.md](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/antigravity/brain/afda43d1-d292-4b66-b058-4ec943124741/AXON_KNOWLEDGE_INJECTION_PROTOCOL.md) (AKIP-V1).

## ⚪ THREAD 8: SIMULATION (VIDEO PACKET) [READY TO START]
- [ ] **Objective:** Generate a "Dry Run" Video Packet using the new `VIDEO_MASTER_CLASS` brain.
- [ ] **Method:** Simulate the chain: Planner -> Orion -> Thalia -> Apollo -> Hephaestus.
- [ ] **Output:** `SIMULATION_VIDEO_PACKET.json`.

## ❓ FAQ: "Modern Agents" vs. L-6 Official
*   **Why aren't Planner/Orion L-6 yet?**
    *   They have >50 Sources (messy).
    *   To be L-6, they must undergo **AKIP-V1** (Substrate Process) to reduce sources to <10 "Knowledge Sheets".
    *   **Action:** This is a future thread (Thread 9: Brain Surgery).
