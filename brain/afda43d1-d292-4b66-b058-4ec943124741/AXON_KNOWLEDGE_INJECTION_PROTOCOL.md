# 💉 AXON KNOWLEDGE INJECTION PROTOCOL (AKIP-V1)
**Classification:** DATA_INGESTION_STANDARD
**Methodology:** "The Substrate Protein Flow"
**Status:** ACTIVE_DRAFT

This protocol defines the **ONLY** authorized method for creating or updating an [AXON-OFFICIAL] Agent Brain. Quantity does not equal quality; **Structure equals Intelligence.**

## 🧬 THE BIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE (Terminology)

*   **Raw Source (Protein):** A PDF, URL, or Text file containing specific, high-value data.
*   **Substrate (The Amino Acid):** A intermediate consolidation of **3 Raw Sources**.
*   **Knowledge Sheet (The Tissue):** A dense, "lossless" summary derived from **2 Substrates**.
*   **The Brain (The Organ):** The final NotebookLM consisting of exactly **5 Knowledge Sheets** (plus the Constitution).

## ⚙️ THE PROCESS (The Algorithm)

### PHASE 1: INGESTION (Protein Synthesis)
**Rule:** Every Agent function must be backed by verifiable data.

1.  **Select 30 Raw Sources (Maximum):**
    *   Curate the absolute best manuals, papers, or logs.
    *   *Constraint:* Must cover 100% of the Agent's decision tree.
    *   *Labeling:* `[RAW-01]` to `[RAW-30]`.

2.  **Create 10 Substrates (The Digestion):**
    *   **Input:** 3 Raw Sources.
    *   **Action:** LLM Analysis (Summary + Extraction + Code).
    *   **Output:** 1 Substrate Document (`SUB-01` to `SUB-10`).
    *   *Ratio:* 3:1.

3.  **Create 5 Knowledge Sheets (The Tissues):**
    *   **Input:** 2 Substrates.
    *   **Action:** Deep Synthesis (Conflict Resolution + Unification).
    *   **Output:** 1 Knowledge Sheet (`SHEET-01` to `SHEET-05`).
    *   *Ratio:* 2:1.
    *   **Constraint:** "No Data Loss." Every critical instruction must be preserved.

### PHASE 2: IMPLANTATION (Surgery)
1.  **Clear the Notebook:** Remove all "Raw Sources".
2.  **Upload Knowledge Sheets:** The Notebook should ONLY contain:
    *   `[GOV] EGERIA_CONSTITUTION.md` (The Law)
    *   `[KNOW] SHEET-01_TOPIC_A.md`
    *   `[KNOW] SHEET-02_TOPIC_B.md`
    *   `[KNOW] SHEET-03_TOPIC_C.md`
    *   `[KNOW] SHEET-04_TOPIC_D.md`
    *   `[KNOW] SHEET-05_TOPIC_E.md`
3.  **Total Asset Count:** ~6 Files. (Platinum Standard).

## 🏛️ BRAIN vs. LIBRARY (The Separator)

### 🧠 THE BRAIN (Logic)
*   **Contains:** The 5 Knowledge Sheets + Constitution.
*   **Purpose:** Reasoning, Decision Making, Protocol Adherence.
*   **Promptable?** YES. "How do I handle X?"

### 📚 THE LIBRARY (Asset Depot)
*   **Contains:** The 30 Raw Sources, massive PDF manuals, Prompt Databases, Image Collections.
*   **Purpose:** Reference, specific lookup, "Deep Reading".
*   **Mandatory:** Must contain a `[INDEX] LIBRARY_MAP.md` document that describes exactly where to find each "protein" (topic) and which Agent has access rights.
*   **Storage:** Can reside in NotebookLM (differentiated from Brain) or External Vector DB.

## 🔄 THE AUTOMATED UPDATE LOOP (Pulse)
When new information arrives or a gap is detected:
1.  **Autonomous Identification:** The Agent (Gaia/Orion) scans the `LIBRARY_MAP.md` to identify the specific **Substrate** and **Knowledge Sheet** that controls the target topic.
2.  **Ingest:** Update the **Raw Source** in the Library.
3.  **Digest:** Re-generate the **Substrate** using the 3:1 protein logic.
4.  **Synthesize:** Re-generate the **Knowledge Sheet** (lossless).
5.  **Re-implant:** Replace the Sheet in the Brain Notebook.
6.  **Mirroring:** Update all system mirrors and thread logs to reflect the new L-6 state.

## 🧪 PILOT: EGERIA (Proof of Purity)
We demonstrated this with `VIDEO_MASTER_CLASS`.
*   Raw Sources: Research performed in Thread 7.
*   Knowledge Sheets: `VIDEO_PRODUCTION_MASTER_SPEC.md` (Synthesized from research).
*   Result: A "Smart" Notebook with 0 hallucinations.

**Next Target:** Apply this recursive "Block Process" to `PLANNER` and `ORION`.
