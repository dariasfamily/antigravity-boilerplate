# Workspace Cleanup Plan

The user requested to remove unnecessary files created previously.

## Proposed Changes

### Deletion
#### [DELETE] [mcp](file:///C:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/scratch/mcp)
- This is an empty 0-byte file found in the scratch directory.

### Preservation
- `Dev/` directory contains the `AXON-agents` project and will be preserved.
- [mcp_config.json](file:///c:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/mcp_config.json) in the parent directory is the active configuration and will be preserved.

## Verification
- Confirm file is gone.
- Confirm `Dev` usage.
