# Rube MCP Configuration Fix Walkthrough

## Changes

### 1. Updated [mcp_config.json](file:///c:/Users/daria/.gemini/AXON/mcp_config.json)
I updated the `rube_mcp` configuration to use the `mcp-remote` bridge instead of the interactive setup tool. This allows the MCP client to connect directly to the Rube server over stdio.

```json
/* mcp_config.json */
"rube_mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://rube.app/mcp"
    ],
    // ...
}
```

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification Required
Since this is a configuration change for the MCP server process itself, you need to restart your MCP client (or reload the window/restart the agent) for the changes to take effect.

1.  **Restart**: Reload your environment.
2.  **Verify**: The error `calling "initialize": EOF` should no longer appear, and Rube tools should be available.
