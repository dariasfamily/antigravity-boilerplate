# 🧠 DEEP TRACE: ROUND 2 REFINEMENT NOTES
**Status**: Accumulating user feedback for the "Deep Logic" pass.
**Goal**: Elevate the "Elite Template" to a "Master Algorithm" level.

## 👥 Agent-Specific Upgrades

### ORION (The Analyst)
*   [ ] **Sub-Algorithm**: Define the exact weighting logic for "Saturation Analysis". How strictly do we define "Saturated"?
*   [ ] **Filtering Depth**: Define L1-L5 filtering explicitly. What constitutes "Low Confidence" mathematically?
*   [ ] **Input/Output**: Define the exact JSON Schema for "PDF Chunks" and "Unstructured Text" execution.

### PULSAR (The Translator)
*   [ ] **Prompt Engineering**: Document the exact "Chain-of-Thought" templates and "Few-Shot" databases utilized.
*   [ ] **Selection Logic**: How exactly does Pulsar choose between Var A, B, and C? (e.g., Entropy measurement?).

### EGERIA (The Orchestrator)
*   [ ] **Input**: Define "Quality Input" metrics. What constitutes a "Rejectable" input?
*   [ ] **Context**: Define the "Hydration" algorithm. How far back does she search in Memory?

## 🛠️ System-Wide Protocols

### Dashboard
*   [ ] **Expansion**: Every agent needs a "Deep Dive" panel to see the raw "Thinking Process" (Sub-Algo visualization).
*   [ ] **Variables**: Identify which variables remain editable *during* execution vs. *before*.

### Auditing
*   [ ] **Granularity**: The 5-Level Audit is good, but Round 2 needs to define the *exact* hash algorithm and storage location for every log entry.

### Knowledge Management
*   [ ] **Notebook Integration**: Every agent must *write* to the Project Notebook, not just read. This creates a redundant "Black Box" outside the DB.
