# 🕵️ ELITE DEEP TRACE: PHASE 6 - CALLIOPE ("The Writer")
**Role**: Creative Director & Scriptwriter.
**Protocol**: Level 5 (Maximum Oversight)
**Dashboard State**: 🔵 `CALLIOPE_WRITING` (Typewriter Cursor)

## 1. THE INPUT ARTIFACT (From Phase 5)
**Interface: Lyra -> Calliope**
Calliope receives **Brand Certified Topics**.
*   **Constraint**: She *must* adhere to Lyra's "Tone Directive" and "Forbidden Words".

### 1.1 Structural Input Object
```json
{
  "concept_ref": "BRD-2026-02-08-001",
  "target_concept": {
    "topic": "Agentic Swarms",
    "angle": "The Death of the Solo Worker",
    "tone": "CYBER_WARLORD"
  },
  "constraints": {
    "format": "YOUTUBE_SHORT_60S",
    "platform": "YOUTUBE"
  }
}
```

## 2. THE PROCESS (Logic Kernel)

### 2.1 Micro-Step: Hook Optimization
*   **Action**: Generate 5 variations of the first 3 seconds.
*   **Selection**: Best predicted retention.
    *   *Var 1*: "AI is changing..." (Weak)
    *   *Var 2*: "Your career ends in 2026. Here's why." (Strong) -> **SELECTED**.

### 2.2 Micro-Step: Narrative Structure (The Body)
*   **Template**: `Problem -> Agitation -> Solution -> Reward`.
*   **Drafting**: Writes the body copy using "Cyber-Warlord" vocabulary (e.g., "Deployment," "Sovereignty," "Kill-switch").

### 2.3 Micro-Step: The "Call to Action" (CTA)
*   **Action**: Determine the desired user behavior.
*   **Draft**: "Subscribe or be obsolete."

## 3. THE OUTPUT INTERFACE (Calliope -> Thalia/Apollo)

### 3.1 Master Script V1
```markdown
# TITLE: THE DEATH OF THE SOLO WORKER
**Format**: YT Short
**Duration**: 58s

[0:00-0:05] HOOK: (Visual: Swarm of Drones) "Your career ends in 2026."
[0:05-0:20] BODY: "The Solo Worker is dead. The Architect survives. Agentic Swarms are here..."
...
[0:50-0:58] CTA: "Build your swarm. Link in bio."
```

## 4. DASHBOARD SIGNALS & CONTROL

### 4.1 Status Indicators
*   **Led Color**: 🔵 **BLUE (Typewriter)** = `WRITING`.
*   **Message**: "Drafting Script... 5 Variations."
*   **Visual**: Live text stream / Scrolling Teleprompter Preview.

### 4.2 User Intervention Controls ("The Editorial Review")
*   **Trigger**: Calliope finishes. State -> 🟠 `WAITING_APPROVAL`.
1.  **[APPROVE]**: Lock Script. Send to Production (Phase 7 & 8).
2.  **[EDIT]**: User clicks on text line and rewrites "Your career ends..." to "The game changes...".
    *   *System Reaction*: Calliope re-calibrates timing/duration.
3.  **[REWRITE]**: "Too dark. Try 'Optimistic' mode." -> Re-runs drafting.
