{"status":"success","answer":"Based on the provided sources, here is the comprehensive Technical Datasheet for the APOLLO agent.\n\n# Technical Datasheet: APOLLO\n\n### 1. Full Name & Version\n*   **Name:** APOLLO (The Audio Engine) [1]\n*   **Version:** 1.1 Consolidado [1]\n*   **Archetype:** The Composer / Sound Engineer [1]\n*   **Tagline:** \"Hear the Future.\" [1]\n\n### 2. Core Role\nAPOLLO functions as the **Audio/Voice Architect** within the multi-agent audiovisual system (specifically located at Step 4b: Parallel Asset Generation) [1]. Its primary mandate is to manage the acoustic dimension of content production, moving beyond simple utility to function as a specialized intelligence responsible for hyper-realistic synthesis, psychoacoustic retention strategies, and rigorous technical mixing [1, 2].\n\n### 3. Key Responsibilities\nAPOLLO’s mission is divided into four strategic pillars:\n\n*   **Voice Synthesis & Emotional Logic:** Generating hyper-realistic Voiceovers (VO) that adhere to \"emotional intonation logic\" [1]. It manages the \"credibility window\" (achieving acoustic believability within 200ms) [3] and decouples vocal timbre from delivery style (e.g., \"Low, hushed\" for authority) to avoid the \"uncanny valley\" [4, 5].\n*   **Automated Sound Design:** Orchestrating the insertion of sound effects (SFX) based on script bracket tags (e.g., `[explosion]`) [1]. It maps these tags to the **AudioSet Ontology** to ensure semantic precision (e.g., translating \"hit\" to a specific \"Generic Impact\" class ID) [6, 7].\n*   **Auditory Retention Strategy:** Implementing \"Sonic Triggers\" or pattern interrupts every 3–5 seconds to break \"scrolling hypnosis\" [1, 8]. It also manages the \"Curiosity Gap\" by silencing music abruptly before key narrative reveals [9, 10].\n*   **Technical Delivery & Mixing:** Producing fully mixed, broadcast-ready audio normalized to **-14 LUFS** (Integrated) with a True Peak of -1.5 dBTP [11, 12]. It handles automated sidechain \"ducking\" to lower background music when voice is present [12].\n*   **Safety & Validation:** Executing content moderation to detect hate speech or toxic content before synthesis [13, 14] and validating technical integrity (checking for clipping or anomalous silence) before handover [15].\n\n### 4. Skills & Tools\n\n#### Cognitive Skills & Operational Logic\n*   **Psychological Profiling:** Selects voice models based on dominance/authority (low F0) or empathy (high/variable F0) requirements [16].\n*   **Prompt Engineering:** Uses \"Style Prompting\" to direct emotional delivery (e.g., \"Speak with enthusiasm\") [4] and \"Negative Prompting\" for music to exclude unwanted elements (e.g., \"no drums\") [17].\n*   **Sonic Branding:** Enforces brand consistency by using specific Voice IDs and optimizing sonic logos to 1–4 seconds to maximize recognition [18, 19].\n*   **Synchronization:** Aligns subtitles with word-level precision using timestamp granularities [20, 21].\n\n#### External Tools & Technology Stack\nAPOLLO orchestrates the following ecosystem of tools [22-27]:\n\n| Category | Tool / Technology | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **TTS Models** | **ElevenLabs** (v3, Flash v2.5, Multilingual v2) | High-emotion narrative (v3) or low-latency real-time response (Flash v2.5) [22, 28]. |\n| | **OpenAI GPT-4o-Mini-TTS** | Instruction-steerable speech for specific \"vibes\" [22, 29]. |\n| **Music/SFX** | **Suno AI** | Generative music creation using structural metatags (e.g., [Chorus]) [23, 30]. |\n| | **Eleven Music** | Studio-grade music generation [27]. |\n| **Processing** | **FFmpeg** | Filters for loudness normalization (`loudnorm`), mixing (`amix`), and ducking [12, 23]. |\n| | **loudgain** | ReplayGain 2.0 scanning and True Peak detection [27]. |\n| **Analysis** | **OpenAI Whisper** | Transcription with word-level timestamps (`whisper-timestamped`) [21, 24]. |\n| | **AudioSet Ontology** | Hierarchical classification for accurate SFX retrieval [6, 31]. |\n| **Safety** | **Azure AI / AssemblyAI** | Content safety and moderation APIs [26, 32]. |\n| **Integration** | **OpenTimelineIO (OTIO)** | Interchanging editorial metadata and media references with other agents [25, 33]. |","conversation_id":"6043b190-60ce-442e-ba52-5af1f3b573bf"}
