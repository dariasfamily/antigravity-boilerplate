{"status":"success","answer":"Based on the provided sources, there is **no mention** of agents named **Egeria**, **Pulsar**, **Argus**, or **Planner**.\n\nThe sources exclusively describe a system called the **\"Sovereign Matrix\"** (or \"Matriz Sovereign\"), which consists of **19 specific agents** organized into 5 levels, as well as a preliminary structure for a \"GEMINI Content Agency.\"\n\nSince the specific definitions for Egeria, Pulsar, Argus, and Planner are absent, I cannot provide their roles or parameters. However, I can provide the **\"level up\" strategies and advanced features** detailed in the sources for the Sovereign Matrix system, which may offer the systemic insight you are looking for.\n\n### **Available Agent Definitions (Sovereign Matrix)**\nWhile the names you requested are not present, the system described includes functional equivalents that might match the roles you had in mind (e.g., a planner or auditor):\n*   **The Chronos (Agente 19):** Likely corresponds to a \"Planner.\" Its role is managing the schedule, dynamic GANTT charts, and deadlines [1], [2].\n*   **The Auditor & ROI Analyst (Agente 17):** Acts as a compass/auditor, similar to an \"Argus\" (all-seeing) figure. It audits performance, calculates ROI, and directs strategic pivots [3], [4].\n\n### **\"Level Up\" Strategies & Advanced Features**\nThe sources detail several advanced mechanisms for system evolution, error correction, and optimization (strategies to \"level up\" the system's performance).\n\n**1. The \"Recursive Sovereign\" Protocol (Auto-Correction)**\nThis is a self-improvement loop designed to prevent the system from repeating errors.\n*   **Mechanism:** When an agent finishes a task, it must audit its result against the Mastermind's objectives [5].\n*   **Feedback Loop:** If the Auditor (Agent 17) detects low performance, it identifies the specific agent responsible (e.g., Hook Master) and records a \"Lesson Learned\" in the ledger [6].\n*   **Result:** In the next cycle, the agent consults the ledger to apply the improvement (e.g., \"Prioritize hook type B over A\") [6].\n\n**2. Strategic Pivot & Scale (The Compass)**\nThe system includes logic to \"level up\" or change direction based on market feedback.\n*   **Pivot:** If a niche is saturated or a tone isn't converting, the Auditor orders a \"Strategic Pivot\" to the Scout (Agent 1) for the next cycle [4].\n*   **Scale:** If metrics are positive, the system scales the budget. If they drop below a threshold, a \"Protocol of Emergency\" is activated to stop production and audit the failure [7].\n\n**3. Sovereign Command Center (SCC) & Checkpoints**\nTo allow for human supervision without micromanagement (\"mínima intervención\" [8]), the system uses a governance dashboard with three specific \"Level Up\" checkpoints:\n*   **Checkpoint Alpha (Strategic):** Validates the idea and angle [5].\n*   **Checkpoint Beta (Visual):** Approves storyboards and aesthetic alignment [9].\n*   **Checkpoint Omega (Market):** Final review before publication [9].\n*   **Override Capability:** The administrator can \"mold\" agents by issuing behavioral overrides (e.g., \"Adjust Ghostwriter to be 20% more aggressive\") [10].\n\n**4. High-Fidelity Knowledge Injection (NotebookLM Integration)**\nA key strategy mentioned to elevate the system to the \"top 1%\" is the use of **NotebookLM** fed with elite-level data [11].\n*   **Strategy:** Instead of using generic training, the system is \"leveled up\" by uploading specific, high-authority PDF sources (e.g., from McKinsey, SEC regulations, cinematography manuals from ARRI/RED) [12], [13].\n*   **Outcome:** This forces agents to operate with \"Imperial\" authority and technical rigor rather than generic marketing advice [14].\n\n**5. Economic Governance (The Treasurer)**\nAdvanced features include financial safeguards:\n*   **Burn Rate Monitoring:** The Treasurer (Agent 18) calculates the \"Cost per Minute of Attention\" and stops production if costs exceed projected ROI [1], [9].\n*   **Asset Protection:** Sensitive financial data is stored in an encrypted \"Vault\" accessible only to specific agents [15].","conversation_id":"31a7a87f-bac8-46c3-88b6-1e4a69d5f3a5"}
